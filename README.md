# Campaign Monitor Data Extractor
Script to extract campaign data for blending in Tableau

This is a basic script to extract a list of campaigns within a client site on Campaign Monitor (it assumes an agency account that manages multiple clients).

The purpose is to then extract relevant data per campaign of the client and save this to a csv.

This data is then blended within Tableau using the email address as the join field.

A user can then enrich their understanding of member engagement.

Current version is just a proof of concept.  But the structure is there to build out additional API resources and create a richer dataset to blend in Tableau.
